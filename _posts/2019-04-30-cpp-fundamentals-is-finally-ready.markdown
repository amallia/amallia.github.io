I am thrilled to announce that **"C++ Fundamentals"** is finally ready! [Francesco Zoffoli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-zoffoli-48ba23110) and I have been working on this for quite a while now.

> Hit the ground running with C++, the language that supports tech giants globally.

If you're a developer looking to learn a new powerful language, or are familiar with C++ but want to update your knowledge with the modern paradigms of C++11, C++14, and C++17, then this book is for you.

## Why do I need to learn C++?

The answer is simple, knowing C++ can pay off for software developers more than any other language or skill. When looking at average salary by engineering skill, C++ typically comes on top.

## What else?

There is more, C++ is one of the few modern languages that can actually teach you computer engineering. Learning C++ will make you understand what is really going on behind the scenes. Also, once you have learned C++ all the other languages will become easy to learn.

## About the book

C++ Fundamentals begins by introducing you to the C++ syntax. You will study the semantics of variables, along with their advantages and trade-offs, and see how they can be best used to write safe and efficient code. With the help of this course, you'll be able to compile fully working C++ programs and understand how variables, references, and pointers can be used to manipulate the state of a program. You will then explore functions and classes — the features that C++ offers to organize a program — and use them to solve more complex problems. You'll also understand common pitfalls and modern best practices, especially the ones that diverge from the C++98 guideline.

As you advance through the chapters, you'll study the advantages of generic programming and write your own templates to make generic algorithms that work with any type. This C++ course will help you to fully exploit standard containers and understanding how to pick the appropriate container for each problem. You will even work with a variety of memory management tools in C++.

By the end of this book, you will not only be able to write efficient code, but will also be equipped to improve the readability, performance, and maintainability of your programs using standard algorithms.

## Objectives

* Work with the C++ compilation model and syntax
* Apply best practices for writing functions and classes
* Write safe, generic, and efficient code with templates
* Explore the containers that the C++ standard offers
* Discover the new paradigms introduced with C++11, C++14, and C++17
* Get to grips with the core language features of C++
* Abstract complex problems using object-oriented programming in C++
