This is my first post in my new personal blog. 
I will use this place to write about technology, programming and, maybe, to keep you updated about my personal life too.

I recently started using Twitter more often, but I realized that sometime is not enough when you want to express a longer or more complex concept. So, in those cases I will write here but please keep following on Twitter if you are interested in my brief opinions too.
