                    <span class="talk-title">Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Search (But Were Afraid to Ask).</span>
                    <p> <small><u>Abstract</u>: Do you really know how search engines work? In this talk I will walk you through the most popular approaches, algorithms, data structures, techniques, and tools. Moreover, search is not just about queries and ranked results, but there are many other features such as auto-complete suggestions, alerts, geo-search... This talk is not meant to be only about theory, but we will see how to practically approach and build a search engine. Attending this talk won't make you a search engine engineer, but you will end up having the basic knowledge of a real search engine.</small></p>

                    <span class="talk-title">C++: Unexpected Behaviour.</span>
                    <p> <small><u>Abstract</u>: Do you really think to know C++? Then you probably want to participate in this talk, you will discover the most surprising, weird, strange or really “WTF” language features you could encounter. There are so many obscure corners of the language that seem to go against common programming intuition. The freedom that C++ gives the programmer may be a double-edged sword; while the user can do many things that have been abstracted away in other languages, it’s very easy to shoot ourselves in the foot.

                    From unintended private member access to unexpected function definitions, in this talk, we will walk you through the quirks that still exist in the language today, and the motivations behind them.</small></p>

                    <span class="talk-title">Backend for Android Developers.</span>
                    <p> <small><u>Abstract</u>: We believe that every Android developer should be able to write a simple but powerful backend without having to maintain a massive boilerplate codebase. So, what’s better than a Java framework and a NoSQL database for storing your data? Moreover, the client code can become really hard to maintain when dealing with common tasks such as RESTful requests or user authentication. In spending time trying to reinvent the wheel, you will lose your focus on what’s really important: your users. In this talk we will learn how to develop a full stack project, from the backend, through the protocol to the Android application.</small></p>
