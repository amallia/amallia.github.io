                    <span class="talk-title">Sparse Retrieval in the Age of RAG.</span>
	     	    <p> <small><u>Abstract</u>: While dense retrieval has dominated recent RAG architectures, sparse methods—long considered legacy—remain central to real-world performance. This talk revisits sparse retrieval in the context of RAG, highlighting its efficiency, interpretability, and surprising ubiquity among top LiveRAG teams. We explore how hybrid systems combining sparse and dense methods consistently outperform either alone, and argue that modern learned sparse models—such as DeepImpact and SPLADE—deserve first-class status in future RAG pipelines. As generation increasingly depends on precise grounding, we call for a smarter, faster, and sparser approach to retrieval.</small></p>

                    <span class="talk-title">Memory for LLMs - An IR Problem</span>
	     	    <p> <small><u>Abstract</u>: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems become central to making large language models (LLMs) more knowledgeable and reliable, a deep disconnect persists between traditional information retrieval (IR) and modern generative pipelines. This keynote explores how IR principles are being reinvented to serve models instead of users, how retrieval affects generation quality, and why existing metrics, architectures, and assumptions often fall short. We revisit 30 years of IR progress to understand RAG’s foundations, highlight emerging challenges like hallucination by distraction and query-length explosion, and argue that memory for LLMs is ultimately an IR problem—demanding new thinking at the intersection of retrieval, architecture, and reasoning.</small></p>

                    <span class="talk-title">Neural Retrieval Meets Cascading Architectures.</span>
	            <p> <small><u>Abstract</u>: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for building knowledgeable AI systems, but its success hinges on the quality and efficiency of the underlying retrieval components. In this talk, we present a comprehensive exploration of cascading retrieval architectures, which strategically combine sparse, dense, and multi-vector methods with reranking stages to balance recall, accuracy, and latency. We demonstrate how using separate sparse and dense indexes, rather than hybrid approaches, improves retrieval effectiveness, and we introduce multi-vector reranking with models like ConstBERT for efficient and high-accuracy final scoring. We also discuss cutting-edge techniques such as E2Rank, which enables computation reuse across deep transformer layers, achieving significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss. Through benchmarks and live demos, we show how these cascading techniques power Pinecone’s next-generation search and RAG systems—highlighting the role of composable, retrieval-centric architectures in overcoming common pitfalls like vocabulary mismatch and long-context failures in LLMs.</small></p>

                    <span class="talk-title">Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Search (But Were Afraid to Ask).</span>
                    <p> <small><u>Abstract</u>: Do you really know how search engines work? In this talk I will walk you through the most popular approaches, algorithms, data structures, techniques, and tools. Moreover, search is not just about queries and ranked results, but there are many other features such as auto-complete suggestions, alerts, geo-search... This talk is not meant to be only about theory, but we will see how to practically approach and build a search engine. Attending this talk won't make you a search engine engineer, but you will end up having the basic knowledge of a real search engine.</small></p>

                    <span class="talk-title">C++: Unexpected Behaviour.</span>
                    <p> <small><u>Abstract</u>: Do you really think to know C++? Then you probably want to participate in this talk, you will discover the most surprising, weird, strange or really “WTF” language features you could encounter. There are so many obscure corners of the language that seem to go against common programming intuition. The freedom that C++ gives the programmer may be a double-edged sword; while the user can do many things that have been abstracted away in other languages, it’s very easy to shoot ourselves in the foot.

                    From unintended private member access to unexpected function definitions, in this talk, we will walk you through the quirks that still exist in the language today, and the motivations behind them.</small></p>

                    <span class="talk-title">Backend for Android Developers.</span>
                    <p> <small><u>Abstract</u>: We believe that every Android developer should be able to write a simple but powerful backend without having to maintain a massive boilerplate codebase. So, what’s better than a Java framework and a NoSQL database for storing your data? Moreover, the client code can become really hard to maintain when dealing with common tasks such as RESTful requests or user authentication. In spending time trying to reinvent the wheel, you will lose your focus on what’s really important: your users. In this talk we will learn how to develop a full stack project, from the backend, through the protocol to the Android application.</small></p>
